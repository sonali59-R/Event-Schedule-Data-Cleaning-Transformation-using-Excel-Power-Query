Concert Event Data Cleaning & Transformation (Excel + Power Query)
In this project, I worked with a messy dataset containing event schedules, ticket prices, cities, and event details in inconsistent formats. Dates and times were embedded in text, some values were missing (TBA), and multiple formats were used for currency and time.
Key Actions Performed:


Data Import & Inspection: Loaded raw Excel file into Power Query for transformation and merge dataset using Append Query into power query .

Date Extraction & Standardization: Parsed event dates from unstructured text, handled blank values, and converted all to proper date format (DD-MMM-YYYY).

Time Extraction & Formatting: Extracted time from text strings (Event begins at 8PM, 4 Hour show starting at 10PM, etc.) and standardized into consistent hh:mm AM/PM format.

Currency Cleaning: Removed currency symbols ($, £) and converted ticket prices into numeric format.

Data Formatting & Cleanup: Removed unnecessary text, handled TBA values logically, standardized city names, and removed duplicates.

Output: Delivered a fully cleaned and structured dataset ready for analysis and dashboard creation.

** Tools Used:**

Microsoft Excel

Power Query

Outcome:
Transformed a complex, messy dataset into a clean, ready-to-use table for reporting and analysis. This project demonstrates strong skills in data cleaning, transformation, and standardization—key requirements for data analysis and reporting.
